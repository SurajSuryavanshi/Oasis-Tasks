                <h3>Childhood </h3>
                <p>Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973 to a Rajapur Saraswat Brahmin
                    maharastrian famiy His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi novelist & poet and his mother,
                    Rajni,worked in the insurance industry.Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, 
                    Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has three elder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita.
                    They were Ramesh's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child.
                    Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East).
                    As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and often picked up fights with new children in his school.
                    He also showed interest in Tennis, idolising John McEnroe. When he was 7 to 8 years, he was a fan of McEnroe
                    and his love for Tennis was on equal level of Cricket, as per him it was time whether I play Tennis or play cricket. 
                    That time he had grown long hairs like McEnroe and use to wear wrist bands and head bands like his Tennis hero and use 
                    to carry Tennis racket wherever go.<br><br></p>

                <h3>Cricket Journey </h3>
                <p>Let us tell you that it was Sachin's elder brother, Ajit, who recognised his cricketing ability 
                    and introduced him to Cricket in 1984. He took Sachin to Ramakant Achrekars academy at Shivaji Park, 
                    Dadar, Mumbai. He was impressed by Sachin and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir 
                    English High School in Dadar. Sachin went to his aunt's home which was nearer to the school in Dadar and took 
                    admission in the school. His career was shaped by the efforts and guidance of his coach Ramakant Achrekar.
                    Do you know that the career of world-famous cricketer Sachin Tendulkar began at the age of 13 years when 
                    he made his cricket debut in the Cricket Club of India On 11 December, 1988 in a first-class cricket match 
                    between Mumbai and Gujarat, Sachin scored 100 not out. Starting from here, he played several cricket matches 
                    at the national as well as international level.

                <h3>"God of Cricket"</h3>
                <p>Tendulkar is cross-dominant: he bats, bowls and throws with his right hand, but writes 
                    with his left hand.He also practices left-handed throws at the nets on a regular basis.  
                    Cricinfo columnist Sambit Bal has described him as the "most wholesome batsman of his time".
                    His batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements 
                    and flourishes. He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are 
                    typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa 
                    and Australia.He is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over square. 
                    He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through. 
                    The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot.In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar, in an article 
                    he wrote in the AFP, remarked that "it is hard to imagine any player in the history of the game who 
                    combines classical technique with raw aggression like the little champion does".Equipment-wise, his 
                    bats tend to be heavier than the average batman.
                    Sir Donald Bradman, considered by many as the greatest batsman of all time, considered Tendulkar to 
                    have a batting style similar to his. In his biography, it is stated that "Bradman was most taken by 
                    Tendulkar's technique, compactness and shot production, and had asked his wife to have a look at Tendulkar, 
                    having felt that Tendulkar played like him. Bradman's wife, Jessie, agreed that they did appear similar.
